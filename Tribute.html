            <p>Lisa, Jisoo, Ros√© and Jennie are, first of all, very talented, beautiful and all of them have a great sense of humour. Everyone of them have different and gorgeous personalities.
            Jisoo is my bias and for me, she is the one with the 4D personality. I love her because of many reasons but one of main reasons is that she's very funny and energetic even in those times where you need to stay calm and focused.</p></div>
